        Dear Students and Parents,
        <p>
            <br>

            The Science Fair Team welcomes you to the Groton Dunstable Elementary Science Fair. We have a mathematical
            formula that we like to use:

        <p>

        <center>
            <b>SCIENCE = FUN</b>
        </center>
        <br>

        <p>

            Our main goal for the Science Fair is for the students to help prove our formula!

        <p>Our other goals are:

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Students learn specifics about a scientific subject through research.
            <li>Students learn to perform a scientific project. <br>
            <li>Students use their creative skills to prepare a presentation on their scientific project.<br>
            <li>Students learn to orally communicate their presentation to judges and the general public.<br>
            <li>Students learn to engage in a friendly competition.<br>
        </ul>
        <p>

        <p>
            We welcome all elementary students from the Florence Roche and Swallow Union schools to prepare a Scientific
            Project and showcase their project at the Science Fair.

        <p>

            We are excited to provide a competitive arena for scholastic abilities and encourage a friendly competitive
            spirit. We hope that students will embrace this spirit and strive to compete at their best level while
            respecting and encouraging their fellow students.

        <p>

            <b>Please be sure to read <u>all</u> the <a href="/rules">Rules</a> and <a href="info">Information</a>
                before starting your project!</b> We would
            hate for you to
            have done some work and then realize you have to start all over because you werenâ€™t following the rules.

        <p>

            We look forward to seeing the many interesting projects that students will present. Good luck to all our
            participants and remember to have FUN!

        <p>
